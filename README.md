# unp

![Build Status](https://github.com/mpolden/unp/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

`unp` monitors a list of configured directories and automatically verifies and
unpacks multi-volume RAR archives as they are written. A combination of file
system events and SFV files are used to determine when archives should be
unpacked.

## Usage

```
unp -h
Usage:
  unp [OPTIONS]

Application Options:
  -f, --config=FILE    Config file (default: ~/.unprc)
  -t, --test           Test and print config

Help Options:
  -h, --help           Show this help message
```

## Example config

```json
{
  "BufferSize": 1024,
  "Paths": [
    {
      "Name": "/home/foo/videos",
      "MinDepth": 4,
      "MaxDepth": 5,
      "SkipHidden": true,
      "Patterns": [
        "*.r??",
        "*.sfv"
      ],
      "Remove": false,
      "PostCommand": "mv {{.Dir}} /tmp/"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration options

`BufferSize` sets the maximum number of file system events to queue in memory.
This should be large enough to store any events that may occur while archives
are unpacked. The default value is `1024`.

`Paths` is an array of paths to watch.

`Name` is the path that should be watched.

`MinDepth` sets the minimum depth allowed to trigger unpacking. A `MinDepth` of
`4` would allow archive files in `/home/foo/videos/bar` to trigger an event.

`MaxDepth` sets the maximum depth allowed to trigger unpacking. A `MaxDepth` of
`5` would allow archives files in `/home/foo/videos/bar/baz` to trigger an
event.

`SkipHidden` determines whether events for hidden files (files prefix with `.`)
should be ignored.

`Patterns` sets the wildcard patterns that a file needs to match to be able to
trigger an event.

`Remove` determines whether archives and SFV files should be deleted after
unpacking.

`PostCommand` is an optional command to be run after unpacking completes.

## Command templates

The following template variables are available for use in the `PostCommand`
option:

Variable | Description                                    | Example
-------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------
`Base`   | Basename of the file triggering the event      | `baz.rar`
`Dir`    | Directory holding the file                     | `/tmp/foo/bar`
`Name`   | Full path to archive file triggering the event | `/tmp/foo/bar/baz.rar`

The template is compiled using the
[text/template](http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) package. Variables can be
used like this: `{{.Name}}`

The working directory of `PostCommand` will be set to the directory where the
archive is located, equal to `{{.Dir}}`.

## Signals

`unp` reacts to the following signals:

`SIGUSR1` triggers a re-scan which walks all configured paths and triggers
unpacking for any archives that are found.

`SIGUSR2` reloads configuration from disk. This can be used to watch new paths
without restarting the program.
